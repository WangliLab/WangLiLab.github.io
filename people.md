She graduated as a bachelor in biotechnology from Wuhan University in 2006 and received her Ph.D. in Plant Evolution from the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2011. She subsequently worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Texas Tech University, Iowa State University and the University of California at Davis. As the first author or co-author, she has published a total of 8 SCI papers, including Genome Biology, New Phytologist.</font></p>


<p style="line-height:1.2"><img src="https://WangLiLab.github.io/picture/licheng.jpg" align="left"><font size="3"><b>Cheng Li，Postdoctoral Scholar</b>: <br>
Cheng graduated from Zhejiang University with his Ph.D degree in 2019, majored in crop crop genetics and breeding. In the winter of 2019, he joined the Wang lab as postdoctoral scholar in evolutionary genomics and characterization of natural product pathway. Cheng is broadly interested in using genomic data to address early vascular evolutionary questions and conbining multi-omics technology to characterize effective component biosynthesis pathway in medicinal plants. He loves sports, such as basketball and football.</font></p>
